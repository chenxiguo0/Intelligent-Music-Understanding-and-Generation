# 2025-spring-project

This is a place to share your project with the instructional team, it's primary purpose is to facilitate file and code sharing.

You can just dump the final version of your project here, so that the instructional team can see it. Don't worry about the number of commits, or the commit history, i.e. having a single commit is fine. We won't be including commit frequency in the grading rubric.

DONT ADD DATA TO THE CLOUD REPO! MAKE SURE TO INLCUDE DATA IN .gitignore 

FYI: DO NOT OPEN MERGE REQUESTS OR PUSH INTO THE MAIN PROJECT REPO

GitHub Classroom recently changed its project setup workflow. Instead of creating isolated template-based repos for each group, it now creates forked repos, where each group’s project repo is a fork of a central "main" repository (the one linked below). I generally feel this is a bad idea, but it is what it is.

Please do not open or accept merge requests into the main project repository (shown at the following link), or clone or push to this repository.

Work only in your group’s forked repo (e.g., project-x)
Never push, clone, or merge into the main repo (again at the following link)
Don’t open or accept pull requests into the main repo
